## Headings

To create a *heading*, add one to six \# symbols before your heading text. 
The number of \# you use will determine the size of the heading.

# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading

## Styling text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text.

## Paragraphs and line breaks

You can create a new *paragraph* by leaving a blank line between lines of text.
