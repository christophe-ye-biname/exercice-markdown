## Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

[GitHub Pages] https://pages.github.com/

## Section Links

You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:

[text](#section name)

## Relative links

A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:

[text](path)

# Mentioning people and teams

You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name.
