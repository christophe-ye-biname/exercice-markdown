## quoting

### How to quote some text you like

you can quote text with a ">"

as becoders always say:

> in code we trust

### And if you whant to quote some code

you can use triple backticks

```
git add --all
git commit -m "a comment"
git push
```
and you can even add colour to make it nice to read:

```javascript
while(becodersAreWorking=true)
{
  MarteauPiqueur=mute
  break
}
```

## Content attachments

Some GitHub Apps provide information in GitHub for URLs that link to their registered domains. GitHub renders the information provided by the app under the URL in the body or comment of an issue or pull request.

To see content attachments, you must have a GitHub App that uses the Content Attachments API installed on the repository. For more information, see ["Installing an app in your personal account"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-an-app-in-your-personal-account) and ["Installing an app in your organization."](https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-an-app-in-your-organization)    

Content attachments will not be displayed for URLs that are part of a markdown link.    

For more information about building a GitHub App that uses content attachments, see ["Using Content Attachments"](https://developer.github.com/apps/using-content-attachments/) in the the GitHub Developer documentation.
